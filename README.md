# FastAPI Path and Query Parameters:

This repository contains examples and explanations of various functionalities in FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs. The README provides detailed insights into the implementation of different features in FastAPI, including path parameters, query parameters, data validation, error handling, and the usage and benefits of each feature.

### Path Parameters:
- Describes what path parameters are in FastAPI and how they are defined in route declarations.
- Provides examples of FastAPI routes with path parameters and demonstrates how to handle errors related to missing path parameters.

### Query Parameters:
- Explains query parameters in FastAPI, their definition in route declarations, and provides examples of FastAPI routes with query parameters.
- Demonstrates how to set default values for query parameters and includes an example of a FastAPI route with query parameters having default values.

### Combining Path and Query Parameters:
- Discusses scenarios where combining path and query parameters is beneficial.
- Provides an example of a FastAPI route that uses both path and query parameters effectively.

### Data Validation:
- Explains how FastAPI handles data types and validation for both path and query parameters.
- Includes examples of implementing data validation for path and query parameters and how to enforce validation rules.

### Usage and Benefits:
- Analyzes a given FastAPI application and identifies instances where using path parameters would be more appropriate than query parameters, and vice versa.
- Discusses the benefits of using path and query parameters in API design and how they enhance API usability and flexibility.

### Error Handling:
- Describes how FastAPI handles errors related to missing or invalid path/query parameters.
- Discusses custom error handling and demonstrates how to customize error responses for cases where required parameters are missing or validation fails.
